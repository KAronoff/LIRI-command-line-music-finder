# LIRI-command-line-music-finder
## Description
Find concerts, movies, and songs using the command line.
## Instructions
From your command line, run the program. It will present a list of 4 choices:
1. "**concert-this**": Will search for a band, and find a list of concerts. It will return venue name, location, and concert date.
2. "**spotify-this**": Using the spotify API, the app will search for a song and return a list of albums that include that song. The list will also include artists, and release date.
3. "**movie-this**": This will search for a movie of your choice. It will return movie title, actors, release year, ratings from IMDB & Rotten Tomatoes, country it was produced in, the language it was originally filmed in, and the plot.
4. "**do-what-it-says**": Reads a text file that will search for a song listed in the file.

After the search is finished, the app will ask if you'd like to perform another search.

## Future Features

I would add a way of logging the searched items.
